# Delaunay-triangulation
A basic unoptimized implementation of the Delaunay triangulation algorithm. Well, not quite, since I do not bother to implement the "flip" process. I sample a list of dots and draw only those which are Delaunay's. Learn more on how to make it better in this [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) article.

Here is the kind of beautiful things this algorithm produces. Even better in real : the points and the traingles move!
